# README: Data Mining and Machine Learning Homework Assignments

Welcome to the **Homework Folder** for our journey through Data Mining and Machine Learning, aka "DMML" (sounds intense, right?). This README was lovingly (read: lazily) generated by **yours truly**, with a little _ahem_ heavy lifting from ChatGPT. Because why do it yourself when you have AI? 🤷‍♂️

## 📝 Assignments Overview

### 📂 **Homework 1**

This is where we ease into the chaos. Topics _might_ include:

- **Module 1**: Introduction, Optimization, and Linear Algebra
  - Aka, "the math we pretend to remember."
- **Module 2**: Regression and Regularization
  - Predicting the future (or just the next quiz score).
  - Making models behave like they're not trying to sabotage us.

### 📂 **Homework 2**

The sequel, where things probably get spicy. Topics could be:

- **Module 3**: Classification
  - Turning data into boundaries and boundaries into bragging rights.
- **Module 4**: Neural Networks
  - Teaching computers to think (or at least memorize).
- **Module 5**: Unsupervised Learning
  - Grouping stuff when we don’t even know what’s in the box.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Dream Team

- **Matteo**: The optimizer who can debug anything (including our lives).
- **Rai**: The algorithm whisperer who probably knows what’s happening.
- **Salva**: The visualization genius. Makes graphs so pretty, they distract from the code.
- **Me**: The lazy one who delegated this README to ChatGPT. Efficiency is a virtue. 💁‍♂️

## 🚀 Tools of the Trade

- **Python**: Because it’s cool and the internet says we have to use it.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: Data wrangling tools we barely understand but love anyway.
- **Scikit-learn**: Makes us feel like real machine learning experts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Where we type stuff and hope it works.

## 🛑 Disclaimer

This README is 100% AI-generated because, honestly, why write when you can click? Laziness is the mother of innovation. If this README feels too good to be true, it’s because it is. 💡

## 📢 Final Words

This folder represents our collective effort, with just the right amount of procrastination and caffeine. If we survive this course, it’s because **Matteo**, **Rai**, and **Salva** carried me.

Enjoy the ride, and don’t forget: “Feature engineering > actual modeling work.” ✌️
